# Windward RESTful V2 Python Client Sample

  
## Setup
NOTE: You NEED to have Python V 3.8.6 (64bit). The included run.bat file will just install the client and run the sample application to make it easier.
To use the client, either include the 'windwardrestapi' folder in your project directory. For more universal usage, include the folder 'windwardrestapi' in the directory where 
your other site-packages are stored, or add the file path for the folder 'windwardrestapi'to your path variable. You could also just use "pip install windwardrestapi". From there you can import different modules from the client into 
your application as depicted in the 'sampleApp.py' file. You could also just run 
```
pip install windwardrestapi.
```
REQUIRED MODULES: You will need to install the requests package. In the command line run: 
```
pip install requests
```
